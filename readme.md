Hello, welcome to the game. 
This project is part of our evaluation for our 2nd year (2nd semester)
in 'ISEN Nantes', the main goal of this project is to program a game where
you can control a character, this character has to go through the level to
reach the finish without touching any obstacle or falling into any hole.
To play, you have to run the program and then press 'New Game'.
You will control the stickman by using the left and right key arrows,
and you can jump using the up key arrow.
To complete the level, you have to go through the red rectangle.
If you unfortunately fall in a hole or touch a vertical bar, you will be
teleported at the beginning of the level!
You can restart the level by pressing 'Restart Game'.
Have fun!

PS: Be careful of the last jump, it's almost frame-perfect!
